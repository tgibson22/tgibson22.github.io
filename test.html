    <h1> Generational Ancestor Calculator </h1>
      This calculator is supposed to tell you how many ancestors you have if you go back a specific number of generations.
   
    <h2> The Accuracy of this Calculator </h2>
      This calculator doesn't account for is when your family tree overlaps, which it definitely does - a lot! As a general rule,
    the more generations back that you go, the less accurate.
    FOr example, if you go back 30 generations (roughly 1000 years), the result of this calculation shows you should have had over 1 
    billion ancestors. This isn't possible if the world population at the time was much less than 1 billion.
